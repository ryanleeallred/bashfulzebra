What makes learning fun for me is when it empowers me to do something new that I couldn't do before. It's also valuable when it's entertaining, uplifting, makes you wonder, or helps you see the world around you in a new way, but I love when my students are able to walk away with capabilities they didn't have when they started.

Students should be able to see the progress in themselves and feel proud of what they've accomplished and how they've changed. 

Students should get feedback on their work as fast as possible. Feedback loops should be as short as possible so that learners can take corrective action as quickly as possible and not lose time going down inefficient paths or developing poor habits.
