I'm getting deja vu from how many times I've set up a dumb blog like this only to lose interest within days... 

Things I want to blog about:

- Progress on personal goals
- Questions that I have that I want to answer
- Tutorials where I re-teach stuff I'm learning to further solidify it in my brain.

We'll see where this takes me. The nice thing is that I really don't care if anyone ever sees this at all. This is for me, not you.
