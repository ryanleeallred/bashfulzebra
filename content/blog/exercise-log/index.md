### March 15, 2022

Ran another 3.13 miles today. At first I thought I might just walk today but couldn't help myself when I got out there. It was the warmest day we've had in months. I'm loving the weather.

Ran the first mile in 10:20 and then walked on and off for the rest. Ended up finishing the 5k in 37:30 for an average pace of 11:55, just 5 seconds per mile slower than yesterday which I was happy about because I was already sore before I started.

Went on a walk with the fam after dinner for another 1.3 miles, so I'm counting that too.

| Exercise        | Distance | Time Elapsed | Average Pace |
|-----------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Running/Walking | 3.13 mi  | 37:30        | 11:55        |
| Walking         | 1.3 mi   | 32:00        | 24:36        |
| Total           | 4.43     | 1:09:30      |              |

It's Pi Day 2022 and I want to get back into running. I haven't gone running all winter besides the occasional indoor soccer game with my buddies. I want to run a sub 3-hour marathon. That's my goal. 

It's almost like I need a blog within the blog for just my exercise stuff... I'll have to add that sometime. For now, I'll just keep adding to this post until it gets so huge that I can't stand it anymore.

Today I ran 3.16 miles (wanted to run a 5k). But it wasn't really running. I ran for the first mile (10:40 pace) and then for the last two I traded off running and walking. I felt pretty good and wanted to run the whole last mile, but then my feet started going numb. This is a thing that has been happening to me lately and I hope it's not a sign of something more serious. I think it's weight related, my BMI is 26.6 which is in the "overweight" category, so I'm hoping that as I slim down and get back into things that this problem will go away over time. My hands also got swollen so maybe it's truly a circulation thing and not necessarily a weight thing... We'll see.

After dinner the family wanted to go for a walk so we walked for another 1.47 miles. So the distance travelled on my feet came out to a total of 4.63 miles. 

My biggest goal today was to not overdo it, (a big challenge for me) and I think I succeeded. I'll be able to go again tomorrow. Maybe not far, and maybe not fast, but I'm just trying to be consistent at this point while my cardiovascular system catches up.s
