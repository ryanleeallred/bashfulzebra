It's Pi Day 2022 and I want to get back into running. I haven't gone running all winter besides the occasional indoor soccer game with my buddies. I want to run a sub 3-hour marathon. That's my goal. 

It's almost like I need a blog within the blog for just my exercise stuff... I'll have to add that sometime. For now, I'll just keep adding to this post until it gets so huge that I can't stand it anymore.

Today I ran 3.16 miles (wanted to run a 5k). But it wasn't really running. I ran for the first mile (10:40 pace) and then for the last two I traded off running and walking. I felt pretty good and wanted to run the whole last mile, but then my feet started going numb. This is a thing that has been happening to me lately and I hope it's not a sign of something more serious. I think it's weight related, my BMI is 26.6 which is in the "overweight" category, so I'm hoping that as I slim down and get back into things that this problem will go away over time. My hands also got swollen so maybe it's truly a circulation thing and not necessarily a weight thing... We'll see.

After dinner the family wanted to go for a walk so we walked for another 1.47 miles. So the distance travelled on my feet came out to a total of 4.63 miles. 

My biggest goal today was to not overdo it, (a big challenge for me) and I think I succeeded. I'll be able to go again tomorrow. Maybe not far, and maybe not fast, but I'm just trying to be consistent at this point while my cardiovascular system catches up.s
