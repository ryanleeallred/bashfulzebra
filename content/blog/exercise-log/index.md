It's Pi day 2022. I want to get back into running. I haven't gone running all winter besides and occasional indoor soccer game with some buddies. I want to run a sub 3-hour marathon. That's my goal. 

It's almost like I need a blog within the blog for just my exercise stuff... I'll have to add that sometimes. For now I'll just keep adding to this post until it gets so huge that I can't stand it anymore.
