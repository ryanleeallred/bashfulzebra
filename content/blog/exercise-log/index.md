Decided to ride a road bike today to work a different muscle group. Rode 12.4 miles in 53:18. Burned 467 calories which is about what I would burn in a typical run, so I'm happy about it. My heart rate definitely wasn't as high though. But maybe that's a good thing.

I was sick yesterday so I didn't get out when I wanted to. Today was mostly about just getting back on the horse and going out. I wasn't planning on going very hard, but then I felt pretty good after the first 5k. If I stop and sit for 30 seconds to let my blood flow catch up when my feet start to go numb then I feel really good when I start again. That made it so that I felt comfortable going a bit further. I decided to try for a 10k to set a new PR there. New 10K PR is 1:05:28. The last couple of miles were a mixture of walking and running as I had to pause for a few seconds here and there to recover. Once I start running these distances more consistently I will need to find a better route because I'm just winding all over my neighborhood.

Super cold and windy again. My goal today was just to run for as long as I could without stopping. Went 4.05 miles in 41:09. Set a new 5k PR for myself running it in 30:53. I hope I can get it to sub 30 minutes soon.

It was a cold and windy day. I was running into the wind on the first half of the run which meant that running back with the wind felt amazing by comparison. Still had a little bit of leg issues, but not as bad today. I tried to wear loose socks and pre-emptively stop to let my blood flow catch back up. 

This was my fastest 5k since having the Nike Run Club app which I've had since October 2018. Just goes to show that I haven't gone running very consistently in the past four years. Consistency is my ultimate goal.

My first mile took 9:27. My fastest mile since I've had the Nike Run Club app is 8:30, but that was mostly downhill, so I'm not sure that it counts.

Ran a 5k, first mile was 9:54 pace which is my fastest mile so far. My legs and feet started to go numb in the third mile so I had to set down while the blood flow caught back up again. This wasn't a problem on Tuesday, so I'm wondering why it comes and goes.

### March 15, 2022

Ran another 3.13 miles today. At first I thought I might just walk today but couldn't help myself when I got out there. It was the warmest day we've had in months. I'm loving the weather.

Ran the first mile in 10:20 and then walked on and off for the rest. Ended up finishing the 5k in 37:30 for an average pace of 11:55, just 5 seconds per mile slower than yesterday which I was happy about because I was already sore before I started.

Went on a walk with the fam after dinner for another 1.3 miles, so I'm counting that too.

### March 14, 2022

It's Pi Day 2022 and I want to get back into running. I haven't gone running all winter besides the occasional indoor soccer game with my buddies. I want to run a sub 3-hour marathon. That's my goal. 

It's almost like I need a blog within the blog for just my exercise stuff... I'll have to add that sometime. For now, I'll just keep adding to this post until it gets so huge that I can't stand it anymore.

Today I ran 3.16 miles (wanted to run a 5k). But it wasn't really running. I ran for the first mile (10:40 pace) and then for the last two I traded off running and walking. I felt pretty good and wanted to run the whole last mile, but then my feet started going numb. This is a thing that has been happening to me lately and I hope it's not a sign of something more serious. I think it's weight related, my BMI is 26.6 which is in the "overweight" category, so I'm hoping that as I slim down and get back into things that this problem will go away over time. My hands also got swollen so maybe it's truly a circulation thing and not necessarily a weight thing... We'll see.

After dinner the family wanted to go for a walk so we walked for another 1.47 miles. So the distance travelled on my feet came out to a total of 4.63 miles. 

My biggest goal today was to not overdo it, (a big challenge for me) and I think I succeeded. I'll be able to go again tomorrow. Maybe not far, and maybe not fast, but I'm just trying to be consistent at this point while my cardiovascular system catches up.s
